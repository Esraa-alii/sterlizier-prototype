# sterlizier-prototype
usage of temperature sensor (lm 35) 

## used element:
1. Ardinuo uno 
2. lm 35
3. lcd
4. pot
5. Bluetooth module
6. 2 buzzers
 
## concept :
•	Our application is the Dry Sterilizer which used for medical supplies, medical devices and others to kill bacteria using high pressure and temperature . it uses  at 105-150 °C, under a high pressure. 
•	6 min: 190 °C
•	30 min: 180 °C
•	60 min: 170 °C
•	120 min: 160 °C
•	150 min: 150 °C
•	Overnight: 105–135 °C

## Why LM35 temperature sensor ?
•	Its range is -55 to 150 which contains the 
range of the steam sterilizer, low cost, greater 
accuracy (-+1), The output voltage can easily be 
interpreted to obtain a temperature reading in 
Celsius.
