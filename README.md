# sterlizier-prototype
usage of temperature sensor (lm 35) 

## used element:
1. Ardinuo uno 
2. lm 35
3. lcd
4. pot
5. Bluetooth module
6. 2 buzzers
 
## concept :
•	Our application is the Steam Sterilizer which used for medical supplies, medical devices and others to kill bacteria using high pressure and temperature . it uses saturated steam at 121–132 °C, under a pressure of 106 kPa (1 atm)

## Why LM35 temperature sensor ?
•	Its range is -55 to 150 which contains the 
range of the steam sterilizer, low cost, greater 
accuracy (-+1), The output voltage can easily be 
interpreted to obtain a temperature reading in 
Celsius.
